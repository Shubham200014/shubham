        <h2>About Ramayan:-</h2>
        <p>
          The Ramayana is an ancient Sanskrit epic which follows Prince Rama's
          quest to rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches of Ravana with
          the help of an army of monkeys. It is traditionally attributed to the
          authorship of the sage Valmiki and dated to around 500 BCE to 100 BCE.

        <h2>Importance of Ramayan:-</h2>
        <p>
          The Ramayana identifies Rama as another incarnation of Vishnu and
          remains the principal source for the worship of Rama. Though not as
          long as the Mahabharata, the Ramayana contains a great deal of
          religious material in the form of myths, stories of great sages, and
          accounts of exemplary human behaviour.

          Duty, Honor, and Loyalty The characters in the Ramayana place a great
          deal of importance on honor, loyalty, and behaving dutifully to their
          family members. Honor and loyalty control every character in the
          story, humans as well as the demons and the gods.
